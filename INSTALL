HOW TO INSTALL THE 'TABLESHOW' PLUGIN
    
    copy 
        plugins/function.tableshow.php
    to the corresponding place in your cmsms installation

    Also append the contents of    
            admin/lang/en_US/tableshow.inc.php 
    to admin/lang/en_US/admin.inc.php
    
These help function files will be overwritten at any upgrade, so an 
alternative strategy is to append them to 
        admin/lang/en_US/local.inc.php
(Create this file if it does not exist.)
Then simply add 'include "local.inc.php";' at the end of admin.inc.php
(but before the closing '?>' ).  You will need to redo this after any upgrade, but
you can insert all your local includes in the one file so they are all re-activated 
at once.
